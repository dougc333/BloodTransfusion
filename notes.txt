I'm in the ER with a stabbing left pain in my back/abdomen. From my 
internet research I assumed this was colon cancer. The doc thinks it's a kidney stone. 

We will see. So I'll work on a blood transfusion app to fit the mood around me.

Everybody around me looks very bad, they are all dying. I wish I could do somehing for them.
Not fun to see people suffer. Very depressing. 

I think when I get out of this I'm going to donate some time/money to health and to these hospitals. Such an epheremal existence.
